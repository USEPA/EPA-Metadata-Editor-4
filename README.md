# EPA Metadata Editor v4.0
EME 4.0 is intended for stewards of non-geospatial metadata records, or for those geospatial stewards needing to document web services or multiple distributions of a single dataset. EME v4.0 provides a core set of elements from the ISO 19115 metadata standard. EME v4.0 supports OMB's Project Open Data Metadata Schema requirement, has an updated user interface, stores template content in open XML files rather than Microsoft Access, and improves clarity in directing users to online resources.

Additional information and resources can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/USEPA/EPA-Metadata-Editor-4/wiki"> EPA Metadata Editor 4.0</a> Wiki.
